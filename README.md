# CV_Parsing_Agentic_AI

This project uses **Agentic AI** to extract data from resumes that are in PDF format by identifying sections such as **Experience**, **Education**, **Skills**, etc.

As I was given a chance to think out box, instead of going in a tradition way and using a single agent architecture I want ahead with a mutli agent architecture.

My first idea of single agent architecture was to give PDFs as input to the PDF text extractor,then give it to the field extractor agent (using smolagent) and later give output in JSON format.

Taking a multi agent architecture would help me concentrate more on extracting sections more feasibly and work on giving the output according to specific sections, hence by creating agents to each section
but there were few crucial points that I thoguht of when this is used as a real world example,
